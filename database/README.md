# database fireXtensions

**THIS LIBRARY IS NOW DEPRECATED IN FAVOR OF THE
 [OFFICIAL FIREBASE KTX LIBRARIES](https://firebaseopensource.com/projects/firebase/firebase-android-sdk/#kotlin_extensions).**

 **PLEASE NOTE THAT NOT ALL THE FIREXTENSIONS ARE PRESENT IN THE OFFICIAL KTX, THAT'S BECAUSE SOME
 FIREXTENSIONS WOULD CAUSE MEMORY LEAKS WHILE OTHER SIMPLY DID NOT ADD MUCH VALUE TO THE SDK. IF YOU FIND
 A FIREXTENSION WITH NO CORRESPONDING KTX, YOU'LL HAVE TO STICK TO THE OFFICIAL KOTLIN USAGE.
 APOLOGIES FOR THAT.**

 **THANKS FOR EVERYONE WHO CONTRIBUTED, SUPPORTED OR USED DATABASE FIREXTENSIONS!**
